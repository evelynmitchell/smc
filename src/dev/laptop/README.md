# Development inside an SMC project

Scripts for doing development of SMC on a personal single-user laptop that you fully control.  You _**must not**_ have anything else listening on ports 5000, 5001, 8080, 28015 and 29015.

## The servers

Start each of the following scripts in their own terminal session:

- `./start_rethinkdb.py`

- `./start_hub.py`

- `./start_webpack.py`

## Use it

Your local SMC server should be running at http://localhost:5000

## Changing the web frontend

Try editing smc-webapp/r_help.cjsx, e.g., changing the heading "Support" to something else.  Watch the webpack process notice the change and build.   Refresh your browser and see the change.


## Changing the hub server backend

Edit files in smc-hub, e.g., `hub.coffee`.  Then hit control+c, then run `./start_hub.py` again.  It's slightly faster if you comment out the `./update_schema.coffee` line in `./start_hub.py`, which is safe unless the schema changes.
