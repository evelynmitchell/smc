## Build Status: Testing and Coverage

We test SMC via [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org).
Here are the results:

* [master](https://github.com/sagemathinc/smc/):
  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sagemathinc/smc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sagemathinc/smc)
  [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/sagemathinc/smc/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/sagemathinc/smc)

DevOps note: The relevant files are:

* .travis.yml - to tell travis-ci what to do (two modes: client and server)
* smc/*/test/mocha.opts - defaults for running mocha
* smc/package.json - the "scripts" section (overwrite mocha reporter, only call `coveralls` when on travis-ci, etc.)

## ARCHITECTURE

  * Client       -- javascript client library that runs in web browser
  * Load balancer/ssl -- HAproxy
  * Database     -- RethinkDB
  * Compute      -- VM's running TCP servers (e.g., sage, console, projects, python3, R, etc.)
  * Hub          -- written in Node.js; primus server; connects with *everything* -- compute servers, database, other hubs, and clients.
  * HTTP server  -- Nginx
  * admin.py     -- Python program that uses the paramiko library to start/stop everything
  * The Cloud -- Google Compute Engine
